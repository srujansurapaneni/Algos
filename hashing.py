# /*************************************       Hashing      ************************************/
# Problem : find the matching keys for a key of interest (keys will change once a match is found)
# 1.for each key of interest iterate over all of the input dataset and distribute them to sparate buckets (hashes) based on a specific feature
# 2.again iterate over each of those piles and distribute them by another feature
# 3. repeat the iteration when no more features are left (remember, do not hash them by unique value/ primary key of the input data
# this is called look-up and hashing. more techniques such as sorting in cobination with bucketing/hashing
